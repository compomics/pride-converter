            Before starting the conversion a couple of last details have to be 
            sorted. First you need to choose where the converted file should 
            be located. To change the folder click in the "Select Folder" icon 
            at the top and locate and select the wanted folder.<br><br>
            When resubmitting a file to PRIDE you have to provide the original 
            accession number of the file. Simply check the "Resubmission" check 
            box and insert the accession number into the now enabled field.<br><br>
            Format specific parameters handles situations that is specific to 
            a given data format. When using OMSSA you need to specify the OMSSA 
            installation folder. The only other currently available options is 
            to round down the Mascot score and threshold to the nearest integer 
            before comparing the two. (You can use this option to emulate the behaviour 
            of the Mascot web results. If you don't know if you should use this 
            option or not it's probably best to leave this box unchecked.)<br><br>
            After clicking the convert button it may take a while to do the 
            actual conversion. If your data set is big, please by patient. The 
            conversion can always be stopped at any time by closing the progress 
            bar.<br><br>
            When the conversion is finished a message with the location of 
            the xml file and some details about the contents of the file is 
            shown. The bottom part of the frame is now also enabled. 
            To submit the file to PRIDE click the "PRIDE Login" button. If 
            you don't have a PRIDE account click on the "PRIDE Registration" 
            button instead.
