            Each protocol step has to include at least one CV term. 
            To add a CV term click on the "Ontology Lookup Service" button. 
            This will open a dialog with a graphical interface to the ontology 
            lookup service.<br><br>
            For some of the CV terms you need to add additional information. 
            For example for the CV term "Enzyme digestion" you need to provide 
            the name of the enzyme used. This is done by clicking in the "Value" 
            column and inserting the given value. Please note that after inserting 
            the value you have to click enter to complete the insertion.<br><br>
            Right clicking in the table opens a popup menu that allows you 
            to edit or delete the CV terms in the table, and change the order of the 
            rows. Editing a CV term can also be done by double clicking on the given row.<br><br>
