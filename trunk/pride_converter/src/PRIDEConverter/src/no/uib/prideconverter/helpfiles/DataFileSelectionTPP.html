            When converting Peptide-/ProteinProphet data you need to select 
            the folder containing the mzXML files, and the following three files:
            (i) the peptide prophet result file (pep.xml), (ii) the protein prophet 
            result file (prot.xml), and (iii) the the TPP properties file.
            <br><br>
            To select the files click on the "Select File" (or Folder) 
            button. You select a file by simply locating 
            the file and clicking "Open". Folders are selected in the same way, 
            but instead of opening it (to see the contents) click  
            the "Open" button).
