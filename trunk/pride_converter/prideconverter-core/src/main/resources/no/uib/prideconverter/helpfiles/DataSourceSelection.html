            PRIDE Converter supports a given set of MS data formats. If your 
            data is not in one of the supported formats (or can be translated 
            to one) the converter will unfortunately not be of much help. 
            <br><br>
            We are however working on extending the list of supported data formats.
            If you have requests for formats you would like to see supported, or if you have any questions,
            comments or suggestions, please send an e-mail to the PRIDE team at the EBI:
