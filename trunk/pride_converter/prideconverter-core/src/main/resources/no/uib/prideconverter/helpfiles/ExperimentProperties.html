            MS data submitted to PRIDE has to be annotated with information 
            about the MS experiment. Title and label is used to describe the 
            experiment, while the project tag allows experiments to be grouped 
            or organized in meaningful ways. The description tag is optional.
            <br><br>
            Contact information has to be inserted to make it possible to 
            contact the people that submitted the data and/or did the experiment. 
            At least one contact has to be included.
            <br><br>
            References are optional but if the experiment is part of a published 
            manuscript it is highly recommended to include a reference to the paper. 
            Please provide PubMed identifier (PMID) and/or digital object identifier (DOI)
            if possible.

            Right clicking in one of the tables opens a popup menu that allows you 
            to edit or delete the items in the table, and change the order of the 
            contacts or references. Editing a contact or reference can also be 
            done by double clicking on the given row.
