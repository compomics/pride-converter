            You can select which spectra to include in the
            PRIDE XML file. There are two options:
            <br><br>
            <b>Simple Spectra Selection:</b> include all spectra.<br><br>
            <b>Manual Spectra Selection:</b> Select the spectra to include by selecting or deselecting
            the spectra in the list. To use this option you first have to load the spectra by
            clicking the "Load Spectra" button.
            <br><br>
            In this frame you can also add spectrum annotations and set the MS level
            of a given spectrum. In order to do this you first need to load the spectra.
            Setting the MS level is simply done by selecting the wanted row and updating the
            the value in the MS Level column. Adding spectrum annotations is done by
            right clicking on the given row and inserting the details into the
            then appearing dialog.
