            When converting DTASelect projects you need to select
            the DTASelect file and the folder containing the spectra files (the MS2 files).
            <br><br>
            To select the files click on the "Select File" (or Folder) 
            button. You select a file by simply locating 
            the file and clicking "Open". Folders are selected in the same way, 
            but instead of opening it (to see the contents) click  
            the "Open" button).
