            If there is anything else you would like to say about the experiment 
            this is where you can do just that. A user parameter has a name and a value. One 
            example could be name: "COFRADICType", value: "MethionineCOFRADIC".<br><br>
            User parameters are optional, so if you don't have anything in particular 
            you want to add, simply leave the table empty.
