            PRIDE Converter can convert data from one data file at the time 
            or from multiple data files if they are in the same format. 
            To select the files to include click on the "Select a File or Folder" 
            button. Here you can select either an individual file (simply find 
            the file and click "Open") or you can select a folder (find 
            the folder, but instead of opening it to see the contents click on 
            the "Open" button).<br><br>
            If a folder is selected all the files in the 
            folder that are in the selected data format will be inserted into 
            the list of selected files.
