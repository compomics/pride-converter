            When converting an MS/MS experiment some of the peptides may contain 
            modifications. In order to include the modifications in the PRIDE XML file, 
            the symbol or name of each modification has to be mapped to corresponding 
            PSI-MOD modifications. This is done using the ontology lookup service (OLS).
            More information about OLS can be found <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            In many cases a default mapping is proposed, but if this is not the case
            or if you want to choose a different modification, simply click the OLS button
            next to the PSI-MOD text field and use OLS to find the correct term. After selecting
            the desired modification, click on OK. You only need to map each modification
            once per conversion.
