            PRIDE Converter provides three ways of dealing with protein 
            isoforms detected in Mascot dat files: 1) always select the first isoform,
            2) manual selection, and 3) provide a list of peptide to protein matches.
            <br><br>
            The first option is the simplest one: select the first protein 
            isoform in the list found in the dat file. In some cases this option 
            will be enough, but in other cases a more advanced approach is needed.
            <br><br>
            Manual selection lets you choose between the possible protein isoforms 
            for each isoform detected. This works, but for larger datasets with
            many isoforms this is not recommended.
            <br><br>
            If a list of peptide sequence to protein accession number matches is 
            known (for example by using protein isoform verification software) 
            this list of matches can be used. If, during the conversion, 
            an isoform is detected that's not in the list, manual selection will 
            be used.
