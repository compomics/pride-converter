            The PRIDE Converter supports a given set of MS data formats. If your 
            data is not in one of the supported formats (or can be translated 
            to one) the converter will unfortunately not be of much help. <br><br>We are 
            however working on extending the list of supported data formats. 
            The formats listed in grey at the top are the ones currently on our 
            short list. But others may be added in the near future. <br><br>If you have 
            any requests for formats you would like supported or if you have any questions, 
            comments or suggestions, please send an e-mail to<br> <a href="mailto:harald.barsnes@ii.uib.no?subject=PRIDE_Converter">harald.barsnes@ii.uib.no</a>.
