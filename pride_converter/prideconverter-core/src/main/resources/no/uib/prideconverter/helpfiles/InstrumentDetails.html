            Information about the instrument used has to be included in the PRIDE 
            XML file. You can create a new instrument set by selecting the 
            "Create a new instrument..." in the drop down menu at the top, 
            or you can select one of the already created instruments in the same list.

            The instruments source and detector has to be inserted as CV terms. 
            To find the correct CV terms click on the OLS buttons behind the two 
            fields.
            <BR><BR>
            At least one analyzer has to be included. To add an analyzer click 
            on the "Add Analyzer" button and add the given CV terms about the 
            analyzer. Each analyser has to include at least one CV term.
            <BR><BR>
            Information about the processing used also has to be included. The 
            name and version of the software used and at least on processing 
            method has to be included. For most of the processing methods you 
            also need to provide information in the "Value" column. For example 
            for the CV term "PeakProcessing" you insert "CentroidMassSpectrum" 
            or for the CV term "Deisotoping" you insert "false" or "true".

            Right clicking in the table opens a popup menu that allows you 
            to edit or delete the items in the table, and change the order of the 
            items. Editing a row can also be done by double clicking on the given row.
            <br><br>
            To delete an instrument, first select the instrument in the list and then 
            click on the "Delete Instrument" button (marked with an X) to the right.
