            To be able to convert data from ms_lims you need access to the ms_lims 
            database where your data is stored. This means that you need a username 
            and a password for the ms_lims system. If you don't have this contact 
            the people responsible for your ms_lims installation.
            <br><br>
            PRIDE Converter requires ms_lims version 6 or newer. If your ms_lims 
            version is older than 6.0, go to 
            <a href="http://genesis.ugent.be/ms_lims">http://genesis.ugent.be/ms_lims</a> 
            and follow the instruction for how to upgrade to the newest version. 
            <br><br>
            When you have the right username and password (and made sure you have the latest 
            version of ms_lims) you need to insert the name of the server host and the 
            name of the database used. For instance:
            <br><br>
            Server Host: MySqlServer<br>
            Schema: ms_lims_DB
            <br><br>
            Again, if you don't know this information, contact 
            the people responsible for your ms_lims installation.
