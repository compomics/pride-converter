            Information about the sample(s) used has to be included in the PRIDE 
            XML file. You can create a new sample set by selecting the 
            "Create a new sample set..." in the drop down menu at the top, 
            or you can select one of the already created sample sets.
            <BR><BR>
            A sample set consists of one or multiple samples. Multiple sample 
            sets is supported to make it possible to insert quantification data. (Currently iTRAQ. 
            Please note that iTRAQ is currently not supported for Peptide-/ProteinProphet data sets.)
            If you are not converting quantification data you most likely only need one sample. 
            Select the "Single Sample" or "Multiple Samples" tab depending on your sample type. 
            You can only use one sample type at the time.
            <BR><BR>
            To add a sample click on the "Add Sample CV Term" (or the "Add Sample")
            button at the bottom of the frame. All sample sets has to include at least
            one sample details CV term. The preferred ontologies are: NEWT for species,
            BTO for tissue, CTO for cell type, GO and DO for disease state.
            <br><br>
            Right clicking in the table opens a popup menu that allows you 
            to edit or delete the samples in the table, and change the order of the 
            samples. Editing a sample can also be done by double clicking on the given row.
            <br><br>
            The multiple samples table contains one sample per row. To add a quantification label to
            a specific sample click in the "Quantification" column for the given sample 
            and select the wanted label from the drop down menu.
            <br><br>
            To delete a sample set, first select the sample set in the list and then 
            click on the "Delete Sample Set" button (marked with an X) to the right
            of the drop down menu.
