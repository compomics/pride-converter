            You can select which spectra to include in the 
            PRIDE XML file. You have tree options:<br><br>
            
            
                <b>Simple Spectra Selection:</b> include either all spectra or 
                all identified spectra.<br><br>
                <b>Advanced Spectra Selection:</b> Select all spectra where the (spectra) file name 
                (partially) matches the list of provided names, or select all spectra where the 
                identification id matches the list of provides ids. If more than one file name or id is 
                given they have to be separated by the same separation character, which can be chosen 
                by the user. To use new line (one file name per line) for separating, simply leave the 
                separator field empty. Note that the selection is <b>case sensitive</b> when applied in this step, 
                but <b>case insensitive</b> if applied without previewing. It is always recommended to verify 
                that your selection is correct before continuing.<br><br>
                <b>Manual Spectra Selection:</b> Select the spectra to include by selecting or deselecting 
                the spectra in the list. To use this option you first have to load the spectra by 
                clicking the "Load Spectra" button.<br><br>
            
            
            If you want to preview the advanced spectra selection before continuing, you first have to 
            load the spectra (by clicking the "Load Spectra" button) and then click the "Apply Selection" 
            button. Clicking the "Apply Selection" button disables the simple spectra selection options.

                There is also a possibility of setting a lower peptide threshold score. This means that 
                only peptides above a given score is included in the PRIDE xml file.
