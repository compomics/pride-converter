            Each sample has to have a name and include at least one CV term. 
            The preferred ontologies are: NEWT for species, BTO for tissue, 
            CTO for cell type, GO and DO for disease state.
            <br><br>
            To add a CV term click on the "Ontology Lookup Service" button. 
            This will open a dialog with a graphical interface to the ontology 
            lookup service.
            <br><br>
            Right clicking in the table opens a popup menu that allows you 
            to edit or delete the CV terms in the table, and change the order of the 
            rows. Editing a CV term can also be done by double clicking on the given row.
