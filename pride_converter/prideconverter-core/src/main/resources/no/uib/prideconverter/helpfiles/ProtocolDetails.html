            <h3>Protocol Details</h3>
            Information about the protocol used has to be included in the PRIDE 
            XML file. You can create a new protocol set by selecting the 
            "Create a new protocol..." in the drop down menu at the top, 
            or you can select one of the already created protocols in the same list.<BR><BR>
            A protocol has to include at least one protocol step and each protocol 
            has to include at least one CV term describing the step. To 
            add a protocol step click on the "Add Protocol Step" at the bottom. 
            <br><br>
            Right clicking in the table opens a popup menu that allows you 
            to edit or delete the protocol steps in the table, and change the order of the 
            steps. Editing a protocol step can also be done by double clicking on the given row.<br><br>
            To delete a protocol, first select the protocol in the list and then 
            click on the "Delete Protocol" button (marked with an X) to the right.

            <h3>Identification Type</h3>
            PRIDE distinguishes between Gel Free and 2D identifications, where the latter
            can be linked to individual spots on 2D gel images in dedicated databases
            like World 2D-PAGE. Select the appropriate technology. If you don't know
            which option to choose simply keep the default selection: Gel Free.
