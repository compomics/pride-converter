            If there is anything else you would like to say about the experiment 
            this is where you can do just that. Here you can add experiment 
            user parameters. A user parameter has a name and a value. One 
            example could be name: "COFRADICType", value: "MethionineCOFRADIC".
            To add a user parameter click on the "Add User Parameter" button.
            <br><br>
            User parameters are optional, so if you don't have anything in particular 
            you want to add, simply leave this table empty.
            <br><br>
            Right clicking in the table opens a popup menu that allows you 
            to edit or delete the parameters in the table, and change the order of the 
            parameters. Editing a row can also be done by double clicking on the given row.
