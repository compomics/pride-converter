            The OLS dialog is an easy and straight forward way of interacting 
            with the ontology lookup service (OLS). More information about the 
            OLS can be found <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            At the top select the ontology you want to search in. Then insert the 
            first letters of the term you want to locate. Note that in some cases 
            a complete search is not done before at least four characters are inserted. 
            So if you don't find the term you are searching for make sure that you 
            have added at least four characters.
            <br><br>
            The OLS can also be browsed as a graph. This option is currently only 
            available at the OLS pages which you can go to by clicking the OLS button.
            <br><br>
            The search is in "real time". Meaning that a new search is started (and 
            the results list is updated) for every character you type. The number 
            behind the search field is the number of currently matching terms.
            <br><br>
            The results are listed in the table in the middle of the dialog, and clicking a term 
            displays additional information about the selected term in the "Term Details" frame.
            <br><br>
            When you have found the term you want to use select the term in the table 
            and click in the "Use Selected Term" button at the bottom of the frame. 
            (Or you can double click on the selected term.)
