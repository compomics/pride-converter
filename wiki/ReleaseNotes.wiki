#labels Featured

*Changes from PRIDE_Converter v1.1 to PRIDE_Converter v1.2:*
 * 'New Sample Step' was mistitled 'New Protocol Step'
 * Progress bars are now used when loading spectra in all spectra selection frames.
 * Fixed a bug that did not allow more than one analyzer.
 * Sometimes the Protocol and Sample name were empty in the xml file even though they were not empty in the converter.
 * The identifications in Mascot Dat files had to be loaded at the spectra selection stage in order to appear in the xml file.
 * The progress bar now no longer stays at 0% when getting IDs for Mascot Dat files.
 * Added an e-mail adress to the otherwise still empty help pages.
 * When clicking the help icon in the dialogs the help page and not the about is now shown.
 * Added a link in the OLS Dialog that opens the browse ontology OLS web page.
 * Updated the About pages.
 * The external links in the help and about pages now opens in the defauls web browser.
 * Updated the information about the data sources and added external links. (But more changes are still needed.)
 * The last used data file folder is now remembered between each run.
 * Changes in the value column in the processing methods table are now detected and results in a question if the instrument should be saved.
 * Sample name is now mandatory.
 * When saving an instrument, protocol or sample set, the option of overwriting or saving as a new instance i given.
 * Previously only peptides with at least one peptide hit was included in the xml file. Now all are included.
 * Previously the references between the spectra and the identifications were wrong. Its now fixed.
 * Fixed a bug that resulted iTraq usage stoping the convertion.
 * Included the number of identifications (both peptides and proteins) in the PRIDE XML Created message at the end.
 * Three alternative ways of handeling protein isoforms has been added to Mascot Dat File convertion.
 * Fixed a bug in the spectra selection frame for Mascot Dat files that resulted in the spectra list doubling when clicking on apply selection.
 * Fixed a bug in the spectra selection for ms_lims data that resulted in spectra never beeing deselected when applying advanced spectra selection.
 * Advanced spectra selection (selecting spectra based on file names) has been added to the Mascot Dat file spectra selection frame.
 * In the advanced spectra selection frames (selecting spectra based on file names) leaving the separator field empty now results in the use of the default separators (line shift, tab etc.).
 * Added an option to round the score and threshold down to the nearest integer before comparison. (To deal with a "bug" in the dat files from ms_lims versions older than 6.0.)
 * Fixed a bug that made it impossible to delete instruments.
 * If an error occurs while parsing a data file the error is now caught and an error message is shown.
 * Example instruments, protocols and samples are now added to make it even easier to start using the converter.

  * Removed the 'Select All Unidentified Spectra' from the Sepctra Selection Frame.
  * Added a more advanced "Advanced Spectra Selection" where multiple (partial) file names can now be given.
  * Fixed a bug that made the 'Apply Selection' button stay enabled even if a loading of the spectra was canceled. Or just when returning to the Spectra Selection frame when the file name criteria field was non-empty.
  * Added a new data source selection frame at the begining of the wizard.
  * Moved the spectrum selection frame to after project selection.
  * Added longer name tags to each frame in the title ("Experiment Details - Step 3 of 8" etc.)
  * Mascot Dat File and Mascot Generic File support added.
  * Simple Data Format Files are now supported (simple MS/MS format).
  * Alpha version of iTRAQ support added.
  * More than one sample can now be added for one experiment. (Needed for iTRAQ, but can also be used without using iTRAQ.)
  * Multiple files can now be selected as the basis for the xml file.
  * Added a "welcome message" in the first frame.

----

*Changes from v1.9 v1.10:*
  * Added a `Preview XML` button in the output frame.
  * The `Add Sample Details`, `Add Protocol Step` and all the OLS buttons in the Instrument frame are now disabled when a sample, protocol or instrument is not selcted, and only becomes enabled if a sample set, protcol or instrument is selected.

----
*Changes from v1.8 v1.9:*
  * Fixed a bug of a missing `/` at the end if the output folder setting, resulting in a wrong output folder beeing used.
  * Removed the error message saying that the user folder can not be found if this is the first time running the program. Now it just defaults to the user_home folder without the message.
  * Fixed a bug that resulted in the Project Selection frame sometimes beeing out of foucs when finished loading all the projects.
  * Pressing `Tab` in the `New Contact > Institution` and `New Reference > Reference` text areas now moves the focus, while pressing `Ctrl+Tab` inserts a new Tab.

----
*Changes from v1.7 to 1.8:*
